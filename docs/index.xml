      <description>Facts About Manatees  Most manatees swim alone and appearing lonely is very offputting No known enemies or predators Ruin good wakeboarding zones on the river with slow speed zones Lack of vertebrae in the neck. They have to turn their entire body around to see behind Canâ€™t breathe underwater. At least learn to breathe underwater if you&amp;rsquo;re going to move there. No system of self-defense. Very weak vibes here. No known agenda.</description>
