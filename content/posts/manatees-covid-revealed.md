### Facts About Manatees
1. Most manatees swim alone and appearing lonely is very offputting
2. No known enemies or predators
3. Ruin good wakeboarding zones on the river with slow speed zones
4. Lack of vertebrae in the neck. They have to turn their entire body around to see behind
5. Can’t breathe underwater. At least learn to breathe underwater if you're going to move there.
6. No system of self-defense. Very weak vibes here.
7. No known agenda. They eat, swim, shit, and sleep.
8. They are strictly herbivores. Be a man. Eat some meat.
9. Unterritorial, they can’t even stand up for themselves
10. Too friendly and just pushovers in general
11. Lifespan of 40-60 years old is longer than any of us should be comfortable with

Since the beginning of COVID, there's been one thing I haven't been able to wrap my head around. An itch that can't be scratched. 

I’m talking about manatees, of course.

While researching fun manatee facts for children, the things I’ve learned have changed me as a person, and I’m certain if you stick around you’ll experience your own revelation.

First off, we need to acknowledge that the manatee as a species are huge pussies, both metaphorically and physically.
If you’ve ever been around a manatee you already know this; if you don’t well, you’re probably a pussy too. They are fat, lazy, and useless. You probably get off on spraying manatees with the hose off your dock, you pervert.

One thing we know about manatees is that they have **no known agenda**. With literally no natural predators, all that is left is to eat, sleep, shit, and swim. What are they *really* doing with all that free time?

They have **_no known agenda_**, but that does not rule out the *existence* of an agenda.

Manatees typically habitate in rivers, sometimes along the coast. They typically travel alone or in pairs.

## Manatees never gather in a group of more than six individuals

The manatees as a species had the *foreknowledge* and *insight* to implement COVID guidelines before the rest of the world even knew it existed.
Is COVID a manatee-made tool for revenge from the pollution of their waters?

Could this be payback for the pollution that the rest of the world would soon follow.

Shocked? I was too.

How long had the manatees known?  about the virus before the rest of the world?  to the COVID guidelines being implemented across the country and world.

The manatees as a species had the foreknowledge and implemented COVID guidelines before the virus was even known to the world.

This is not only suspicious, **it’s downright terrifying**.
